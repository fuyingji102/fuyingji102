### Hi ðŸ‘‹! Here is **Fu Yingji**. 

I am currently pursuing a master's degree at the [BME](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/bme/), [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), specializing in the intersection of artificial intelligence and medical image analysis. With a background in researching medical pathological images and CT scans during my undergraduate studies, I am eager to expand my knowledge in the field of neuroscience and learn about advanced imaging techniques used in brain science. My primary interest lies in leveraging artificial intelligence to further our understanding of brain imaging and its applications in neuroscience.

Furthermore, I am thrilled to broaden my knowledge in other disciplines, such as medical robotics and drug delivery. I aspire to delve into these areas and contribute to the advancement of healthcare technology in the future.  Please learn more about me from my [personal website](https://fuyingji102.github.io/Fuyingji/).
